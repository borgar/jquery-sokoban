# Sōkoban

An implementation of Sokōban in JavaScript, as a [jQuery] plugin. It parses and runs the de-facto standardized Sokoban puzzle notation, is capable of running multiple games and includes a separate undo buffer for each one. It's about 300 lines of code.

## How to use

1. Include a reference to the plugin (and jQuery) to the `<head>` section of your document:
```html
<script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="jquery.sokoban.js"></script>
```

2. Add a Sokoban puzzle to your HTML document:
```html
<pre class="sokoban">
####
# .#
#  ###
#*@  #
#  $ #
#  ###
####
</pre>
```
3. Run the game when the document loads:
```html
<script>
jQuery(function($){
  $('pre.sokoban').sokoban();
});
</script>
```

4. Consider adding CSS styles to make the levels look nicer (some are included in the project).
